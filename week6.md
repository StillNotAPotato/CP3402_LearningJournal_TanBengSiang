# Week 6

# Learning Journal
For this week, we were exposed to the use and importance of collaborative tools actively used in the industry. These tools were Trello, Github and Slack. This was not new information to me as I have had prior experience with the use of said tools before, rather this week's learning served as a refresher for me to get reacquainted with these collaborative tools. Pasted below are the links to the videos I watched.

# Estimated Hours
This week I spent, cumalatively speaking, 4 to 5 hours on CMS.

# Goal
Reacquire knowledge of using collaborative tools in order to work effectively together with my teammates, and contribute meaningfuly to any assigned tasks.

# SMART Goal
Specific: Attain level of profiency in using collaborative tools (Trello, Github, Git and Slack)

Measureable: Within 7 days, until the next practical, I will allocate 30mins per day actively exploring and learning each collaborative tools due to current heavy workload at work.
Achieveable: I am to take full advantage of online tutorials, user forums and guides posted on YouTube.

Relevant: Gaining a competent, working understanding of using such collaborative tools will not only be beneficial for the project work ahead, but also when the time comes to enter the industry. At work, the collaborative tool I most frequently use is Microsoft Teams and Sharepoint.

Time Bound: By the end of this week, I aim to have a working, competent understanding and knowledge in using collaborative tools.

# Content Insights
From the video tutorials I had watched on YouTube, I gained new insights into how a web developer might collaborate with his/her team using communication tools such as Slack, or Teams (which is the tool being used in the company I am doing my internship at). As students, even though we lack work experience, we can make up for it by being competent users of industry-standard collaborative tools for communicating with teammates, or version control tools such as Github/Git.

# Career/Learning/Employability Insights
This week's refresher on collaborative tools proved to be extremely valuable and worthwhile to go through as it is the bread and butter of any developer regardless of which field he/she is in. Being in a highly competitive industry, having the knowledge and/or usage experience of these standard tools are something that employers expect fresh graduates to have.
